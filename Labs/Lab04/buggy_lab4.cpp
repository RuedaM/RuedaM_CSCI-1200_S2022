1. How does the output from your memory debugger differ when you compile your program with the -g
flag compared to when you leave it out?
ANSWER:
Without -g, Dr Memory will nt be able to give line number information and cannot pinpoint where in the file memory is leaking

2. How would you rewrite the for loop in part 2 to use the bracket [] operator instead of pointer syntax?
ANSWER:
for (int i = *numElements-1; i > -1; i--) {                                  // changed counter so that it counts only as many numbers as there are
       // If we're at the beginning of the for loop, initalize *smallestNum         // also changed looping boolean
       // Else, compare *smallestNum to current element in the for loop
       if (i+1 == *numElements) {                                               // changed to i+1 since i counts index
           *smallestNum = intArray[i];                                          // als changed equivalence: numElements is the most # of elements
       }

       else {
           if (*smallestNum > intArray[i]) {
               *smallestNum = intArray[i]);

3. For DrMemory users, you wouldâ€™ve encountered all of these errors in parts 1, 2, or 3 of Checkpoint 2:
UNITIALIZED READ
UNADDRESSABLE ACCESS
INVALID HEAP ARGUMENT
LEAK
What do you think each of these errors mean?
ANSWER:
Uninitialized Read: A memory address exists, but there is no value within it
Unaddressable Access: Tryig to read a memory address that has not been allocated
Invalid Heap Argument: The heap memory address is invalid - may not exist/incorrect address
Leak: There is a possible leak, most likely due to a pointer mismatch that leaves a heap variable not attached to a pointer
